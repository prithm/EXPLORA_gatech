The second bill for $130 charges a flat $50 late fee per month and is 6 months overdue. The last bill is two months late and charges a $40 fee the first month overdue and twice that fee the second month overdue and is for $444. How much does Ariana owe in total?,"First find the monthly late fee for the first bill: $200 * 10% = $<<200*10*.01=20>>20

Then find the third bill's second late fee: 2 * $40 = $<<2*40=80>>80

Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?","Rupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old â€“ 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old.
Khloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old â€“ 10 years = 10 years old.
Eugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old.
Yorick is twice Eugeneâ€™s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old.
Amilia is a quarter of Yorickâ€™s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old.
Tricia is a third of Amiliaâ€™s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old.

The building has twenty flights of stairs to the top floor, and Ned can run up one flight of stairs in eleven seconds. The time bomb has 72 seconds left on the timer, and Ned has spent 165 seconds running up the stairs. How many seconds will Ned have to diffuse the bomb when he reaches it?","Ned has gone up 165 / 11 = <<165/11=15>>15 flights of stairs.
Thus, he has 20 - 15 = <<20-15=5>>5 flights of stairs left to run up.
He will spend 5 * 11 = <<5*11=55>>55 seconds running up the remaining stairs to the bomb.
Therefore, he will have 72 - 55 = <<72-55=17>>17 seconds to defuse the bomb.

Twenty more than 10 times Sierra's age is 300+20 = 320
320 is 40 less than ten times Diaz's age so 10 times Diaz's age is 320+40 = 360
If ten times Diaz's age is 360, Diaz is 360/10 = <<360/10=36>>36 years old.
