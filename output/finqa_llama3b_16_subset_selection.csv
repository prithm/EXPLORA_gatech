( 201cedf 201d ) completed the acquisition of an additional 3.5% ( 3.5 % ) interest in light from two sub- sidiaries of reliant energy for approximately $ 136 mil- lion . pursuant to the acquisition , the company acquired 30% ( 30 % ) of the shares while edf acquired the remainder . with the completion of this transaction , the company owns approximately 21.14% ( 21.14 % ) of light . in december 2000 , a subsidiary of the company entered into an agreement with edf to jointly acquire an additional 9.2% ( 9.2 % ) interest in light , which is held by a sub- sidiary of companhia siderurgica nacional ( 201ccsn 201d ) . pursuant to this transaction , the company acquired an additional 2.75% ( 2.75 % ) interest in light for $ 114.6 million . this transaction closed in january 2001 . following the purchase of the light shares previously owned by csn , aes and edf will together be the con- trolling shareholders of light and eletropaulo . aes and edf have agreed that aes will eventually take operational control of eletropaulo and the telecom businesses of light and eletropaulo , while edf will eventually take opera- tional control of light and eletropaulo 2019s electric workshop business . aes and edf intend to continue to pursue a fur- ther rationalization of their ownership stakes in light and eletropaulo , the result of which aes would become the sole controlling shareholder of eletropaulo and edf would become the sole controlling shareholder of light . upon consummation of the transaction , aes will begin consolidating eletropaulo 2019s operating results . the struc- ture and process by which this rationalization may be effected , and the resulting timing , have yet to be deter- mined and will likely be subject to approval by various brazilian regulatory authorities and other third parties . as a result , there can be no assurance that this rationalization will take place . in may 1999 , a subsidiary of the company acquired subscription rights from the brazilian state-controlled eletrobras which allowed it to purchase preferred , non- voting shares in eletropaulo and common shares in light . the aggregate purchase price of the subscription rights and the underlying shares in light and eletropaulo was approximately $ 53 million and $ 77 million , respectively , and represented 3.7% ( 3.7 % ) and 4.4% ( 4.4 % ) economic ownership interest in their capital stock , respectively . the following table presents summarized financial information ( in millions ) for the company 2019s investments in 50% ( 50 % ) or less owned investments accounted for using the equity method: .","as of and for the years ended december 31, | 2000 | 1999 | 1998 |

i g at i o n s the following table presents a summary of our future obligations ( in a0millions ) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 , 2011 . other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated , under certain conditions that may involve termination fees . because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature , we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations . the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2012 and future years . the information also excludes the $ 4.7 a0million of uncertain tax positions discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities. . we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment totaling $ 42.5 a0million at december 31 , 2011 . c r i t i c a l a c c o u n t i n g p o l i c i e s the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives . further , significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet , the revenues and expenses in our statement of income , and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements . making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time . accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes . we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined . n e w ly i s s u e d b u t n o t y e t a d o p t e d a c c o u n t i n g g u i d a n c e in may 2011 , the fasb issued amended guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value . we do not believe the adoption of such amended guidance on january 1 , 2012 , will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements . we have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements , including that which we have not yet adopted . we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. ."," | total | 2012 | 2013-14 | 2015-16 | later |

fossil operating costs due to the purchase of the attala plant in january 2006 and the perryville plant coming online in july 2005 ; n an increase of $ 12 million related to storm reserves . this increase does not include costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita ; and n an increase of $ 12 million due to a return to normal expense patterns in 2006 versus the deferral or capitalization of storm costs in 2005 . other operation and maintenance expenses increased for non- utility nuclear from $ 588 million in 2005 to $ 637 million in 2006 primarily due to the timing of refueling outages , increased benefit and insurance costs , and increased nrc fees . taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased for the utility from $ 322 million in 2005 to $ 361 million in 2006 primarily due to an increase in city franchise taxes in arkansas due to a change in 2006 in the accounting for city franchise tax revenues as directed by the apsc . the change results in an increase in taxes other than income taxes with a corresponding increase in rider revenue , resulting in no effect on net income . also contributing to the increase was higher franchise tax expense at entergy gulf states , inc . as a result of higher gross revenues in 2006 and a customer refund in 2005 . other income other income increased for the utility from $ 111 million in 2005 to $ 156 million in 2006 primarily due to carrying charges recorded on storm restoration costs . other income increased for non-utility nuclear primarily due to miscellaneous income of $ 27 million ( $ 16.6 million net-of-tax ) resulting from a reduction in the decommissioning liability for a plant as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study and changes in assumptions regarding the timing of when decommissioning of a plant will begin . other income increased for parent & other primarily due to a gain related to its entergy-koch investment of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) in the fourth quarter of 2006 . in 2004 , entergy-koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third parties . at that time , entergy received $ 862 million of the sales proceeds in the form of a cash distribution by entergy-koch . due to the november 2006 expiration of contingencies on the sale of entergy-koch 2019s trading business , and the corresponding release to entergy-koch of sales proceeds held in escrow , entergy received additional cash distributions of approximately $ 163 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 and recorded a gain of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) . entergy expects future cash distributions upon liquidation of the partnership will be less than $ 35 million . interest charges interest charges increased for the utility and parent & other primarily due to additional borrowing to fund the significant storm restoration costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita . discontinued operations in april 2006 , entergy sold the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the electric reliability council of texas ( ercot ) region of texas , and now reports this portion of the business as a discontinued operation . earnings for 2005 were negatively affected by $ 44.8 million ( net-of-tax ) of discontinued operations due to the planned sale . this amount includes a net charge of $ 25.8 million ( net-of-tax ) related to the impairment reserve for the remaining net book value of the competitive retail services business 2019 information technology systems . results for 2006 include an $ 11.1 million gain ( net-of-tax ) on the sale of the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the ercot region of texas . income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 27.6% ( 27.6 % ) and 36.6% ( 36.6 % ) , respectively . the lower effective income tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to tax benefits , net of reserves , resulting from the tax capital loss recognized in connection with the liquidation of entergy power international holdings , entergy 2019s holding company for entergy-koch . also contributing to the lower rate for 2006 is an irs audit settlement that allowed entergy to release from its tax reserves all settled issues relating to 1996-1998 audit cycle . see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% ( 35.0 % ) to the effective income tax rates , and for additional discussion regarding income taxes . liquidity and capital resources this section discusses entergy 2019s capital structure , capital spending plans and other uses of capital , sources of capital , and the cash flow activity presented in the cash flow statement . capital structure entergy 2019s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt , as shown in the following table . the increase in the debt to capital percentage from 2006 to 2007 is primarily the result of additional borrowings under entergy corporation 2019s revolving credit facility , along with a decrease in shareholders 2019 equity primarily due to repurchases of common stock . this increase in the debt to capital percentage is in line with entergy 2019s financial and risk management aspirations . the decrease in the debt to capital percentage from 2005 to 2006 is the result of an increase in shareholders 2019 equity , primarily due to an increase in retained earnings , partially offset by repurchases of common stock. . net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents . debt consists of notes payable , capital lease obligations , preferred stock with sinking fund , and long-term debt , including the currently maturing portion . capital consists of debt , shareholders 2019 equity , and preferred stock without sinking fund . net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents . entergy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes
